# AtomicAds DB â€” Alerting & Notification Platform

**AtomicAds DB** is a lightweight alerting and notification platform that allows admins to create and manage alerts while delivering in-app notifications to users. End users can view, snooze, and mark alerts as read/unread. The system also provides analytics to track alert delivery, reads, and snoozes.
